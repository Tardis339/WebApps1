#### Age 1-5
I was born in [Los Angeles, California.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles?scrlybrkr=9a82eed9) At the age of only about 8 weeks I moved to [Berlin, Germany](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berlin?scrlybrkr=9a82eed9) and I lived there until I was about one-and-a-half. I moved back to a small town in [California](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California?scrlybrkr=9a82eed9) called [Santa Monica.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santa_Monica,_California?scrlybrkr=9a82eed9) I lived in a small black and white house and I lived there until I was about twenty-eight weeks old. I than moved to an [amazing yellow house.](https://www.google.com/maps/place/508+Marguerita+Ave,+Santa+Monica,+CA+90402/@34.0285151,-118.5066907,3a,60y,132.47h,87.59t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sVrzim2vDVLEwQkA2pMfC1g!2e0!7i13312!8i6656!4m5!3m4!1s0x80c2a4bc2ee5e451:0xd0f610d7361d4681!8m2!3d34.028156!4d-118.506327!6m1!1e1)(it is no longer yellow, we repainted it) For me it was a dream house. At that age I didn't care about the pool I had, I didn't care about the huge back yard. I didn't evan care that my room was ten times bigger than before. At the time what I cared about was the giant bag of expired [_M&Ms_](http://www.mms.com/) I found hidden in an old cabinet in the kitchen. I was smarter than your average 3 year old because that bag lasted for an entire year and when it ran out I cried for four hours. My parents eventually got me a new bag of them but it was much smaller and they tasted a little funny (they weren't expired). I didn't like them and ended up giving them to my brother Luca.
